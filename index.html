                    Through analyzing both maps, I found that there was a inverse correlation between states with low AP enrollment and states with high AP Scores.
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        I started off by looking at the participation map. Noticing that the majority of the nation had low AP Participation, I wondered what scores these states were getting. Resultingly, I created another map to analyze the scores. College Board however, does not give specific scores for each state - instead they simply give percentages of students that scored a 3 or above (passing). Putting the two maps side by side, I noticed that many of the states with low populations were scoring high. Intrigued, I decided to combine the two maps together.
                        <br><br>
                        In this map, I plotted all states with <b>low</b> participation and <b>low scores</b> to be <span class="dark-blue">dark blue</span>, and states with <b>low</b> participation and <b>high scores</b> to be <span class="light-blue">light blue</span>. For the <b>high</b> population states, I used <span class="green">green</span> to represent high scoring states and <span class="violet">violet</span> for <b>high</b> participation states with low scores.
